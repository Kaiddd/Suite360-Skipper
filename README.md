# Suite360-Skipper
For depressed programmers who don't care about this stupid "mental health" shit (joke)

Made by Kaede

To use:

	- Start a lesson
	- Complete pre-test
	- Run the script in devconsole
	- When it gets stuck at the end, refresh
	- May have to click next two or three times to get to the post-test
	- Complete post-test (This can be easily cheated via a local override of the page, not making something to do this automatically on github though, find it yourself if you're really too dumb to answer these questions)
